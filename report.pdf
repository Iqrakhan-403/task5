DATA ANALYST INTERNSHIP
Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective:

Extract insights from the Titanic dataset using visual and statistical exploration.

Tools:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

1. Dataset Overview

Dataset: Titanic Dataset ([Kaggle / Seaborn])

Rows × Columns: 891 × 12

Columns: PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked

Missing Values:

Age: 177 missing

Cabin: 687 missing

Embarked: 2 missing

2. Data Exploration
a. Basic Exploration

Used .info() to understand dataset structure.

Used .describe() to get summary statistics for numerical features.

Used .value_counts() to check categorical distributions (Sex, Pclass).

3. Visual Analysis
a. Univariate Analysis

Age Distribution: Most passengers are aged 20–40.
(Insert histogram of Age)

Sex Distribution: Majority of passengers are male.
(Insert bar chart of Sex)

Passenger Class Distribution: Most passengers traveled in 3rd class.
(Insert bar chart of Pclass)

b. Bivariate Analysis

Survival by Sex: Women have higher survival rates than men.
(Insert grouped bar chart)

Survival by Passenger Class: First-class passengers have better survival chances.
(Insert grouped bar chart)

Age vs Fare (Scatter Plot): Higher fare and younger passengers are more likely to survive.
(Insert scatter plot)

c. Multivariate Analysis

Correlation Matrix & Heatmap:

Survival positively correlates with Fare and negatively with Pclass.

Weak correlation between Age, SibSp, and Parch.
(Insert heatmap)

4. Observations from Visuals

Majority of passengers are male and in 3rd class.

Women had higher survival probability.

Higher-class passengers survived more frequently.

Younger adults dominated the passenger age distribution.

Fare is a strong factor associated with survival.

5. Summary of Findings

Passengers’ sex, class, age, and fare strongly influence survival.

Women and higher-class passengers have higher survival chances.

Younger adults were the most frequent group on the Titanic.

Further analysis could explore family size (SibSp + Parch) as a survival factor.

6. Interview Questions

What is EDA and why is it important?

EDA is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics using statistics and visualization. It helps identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships, which is crucial before modeling.

Which plots do you use to check correlation?

Heatmaps, scatterplots, pairplots.

How do you handle skewed data?

Apply transformations (log, sqrt, Box-Cox) or use robust statistical models.

How to detect multicollinearity?

Correlation matrix or Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses?

Univariate: Single variable (e.g., histogram of Age)

Bivariate: Two variables (e.g., Survival vs Sex)

Multivariate: More than two variables (e.g., Age vs Fare vs Survival)

Difference between heatmap and pairplot?

Heatmap: Shows correlation strength between variables.

Pairplot: Shows scatterplots for all variable pairs with distributions.

How do you summarize your insights?

Highlight key patterns, relationships, and anomalies supported by visuals and statistics.

7. Tools & Methods Used

Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Functions used: .info(), .describe(), .value_counts()

Visualizations: histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps

8. Task Outcome

Gained practical skills in identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies.

Prepared data-driven insights suitable for reporting or modeling.
